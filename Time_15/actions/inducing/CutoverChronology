    TextElement: GJChronology provides access to the individual date time fields for the [3121,3192]
    TextElement: Gregorian/Julian defined chronological calendar system. [3196,3251]
    TextElement: <p> [3255,3258]
    TextElement: The Gregorian calendar replaced the Julian calendar, and the point in time [3262,3336]
    TextElement: when this chronology switches can be controlled using the second parameter [3340,3414]
    TextElement: of the getInstance method. By default this cutover is set to the date the [3418,3491]
    TextElement: Gregorian calendar was first instituted, October 15, 1582. [3495,3553]
    TextElement: <p> [3557,3560]
    TextElement: Before this date, this chronology uses the proleptic Julian calendar [3564,3632]
    TextElement: (proleptic means extending indefinitely). The Julian calendar has leap  [3636,3707]
    TextElement: years every four years, whereas the Gregorian has special rules for 100  [3711,3783]
    TextElement: and 400 years. A meaningful result will thus be obtained for all input  [3787,3858]
    TextElement: values. However before March 1, 4 CE, Julian leap years were irregular, [3862,3933]
    TextElement: and before 45 BCE there was no Julian calendar. [3937,3984]
    TextElement: <p> [3988,3991]

    TextElement: correctly. Thus year 1 BCE is returned as -1 instead of 1. The yearOfEra [4128,4200]
    TextElement: field produces results compatible with GregorianCalendar. [4204,4261]
    TextElement: <p> [4265,4268]
    TextElement: The Julian calendar does not have a year zero, and so year -1 is followed by [4272,4348]
    TextElement: year 1. If the Gregorian cutover date is specified at or before year -1 [4352,4423]
    TextElement: (Julian), year zero is defined. In other words, the proleptic Gregorian [4427,4498]
    TextElement: chronology implemented by this class has a year zero. [4502,4555]
    TextElement: <p> [4559,4562]
    TextElement: To create a pure proleptic Julian chronology, use  [4566,4616]
    TagElement [4616,4640]
        SimpleName: JulianChronology [4623,4639]
