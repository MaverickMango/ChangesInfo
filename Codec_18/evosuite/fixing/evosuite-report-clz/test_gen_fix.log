done.
Note: switching to '5ef5bd199a4e3df74479b4b363fa29b0b3092547'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at 5ef5bd19 CODEC-231 StringUtils.equals(CharSequence cs1, CharSequence cs2) can fail with String Index OBE
