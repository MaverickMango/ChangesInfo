Note: switching to '1028b37a1dfbc5dda7b18cbe692ab168c54fb505'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

   * Bugfix: when parsing from a URL, an end tag could be read incorrectly if it started on a buffer boundary.

   * Bugfix: when parsing from a URL, if the remote server failed to complete its write (i.e. it writes less than the
     Content Length header promised on a gzipped stream), the parse method would incorrectly throw an unchecked
     exception. It now throws the declared IOException.
-    <https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/980>

-  * Bugfix: leaf nodes (such as text nodes) where throwing an unsupported operation exception on childNodes(), instead
-    of just returning an empty list.

+      <https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/980>
 
 *** Release 1.11.2 [2017-Nov-19]
   * Improvement: added a new pseudo selector :matchText, which allows text nodes to match as if they were elements.
